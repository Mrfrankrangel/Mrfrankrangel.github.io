### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 part 1 was my favorite due to how it introduced me to the world of
    Computer Science and coding. I was able to meet my lab partner and new 
    friends that I hang out with outside of the lab.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 1 and 2 are favorites of mine due to the people I worked with
    durning the lab. The person was very respectful and helpful and helped me
    and now we are very good friends.
